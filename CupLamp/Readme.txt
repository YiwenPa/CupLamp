Welcome to my innovative project utilizing the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express! This project is an exploration into the fascinating world of technology, where I have merged creativity with functionality. It's not just about creating a device; it's about experiencing how movement, light, and sound can interact in magical and musical ways.

Project Description
This project uses the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express to transform motion and light into an interactive audio-visual display. The key concept is to make technology more tangible and interactive, turning the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express into a device that responds to its environment in unique ways.

Key Features

The necessary methods for operation are pre-made by MakeCode, and we simply need to call them. There are two functions to be called: one is the light intensity function, controlled by gravitational acceleration. The other is Tone, controlled by light intensity. Then, download the uf2 file packaged by the website, burn it into the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express Base Kit, and run it.
Motion-Sensitive Music: The onboard accelerometer detects motion, triggering various musical notes and tunes.
LED Visual Feedback: The device uses LED lights to provide visual feedback in response to motion and environmental changes.
Interactive and Educational: This project is designed not only to entertain but also to educate about the basics of sensors, programming, and digital-to-physical interactions.
Tools and Materials
Adafruit Circuit Playground Express
Paper coffee cup (12 oz size) for housing the device
Tape (masking, duct tape, or packing tape) for assembly
Scissors for modifications
Computer with programming software for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express
Setup Instructions
Assemble the Device: Securely place the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express inside the paper coffee cup using tape. This serves as the housing for the device.
Programming the Device: Connect the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express to your computer. Use the provided code to program its sensors and LEDs to respond to motion and light.
Testing and Calibration: After programming, test the device by moving it in different ways and exposing it to various light conditions to ensure responsive musical and light output.
Usage
Tilt or move the device in different directions to produce and alter musical notes.
Expose the device to different light intensities to change the music's pitch and tone.
